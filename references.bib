The eyes and brain take advantage of this similarity to encode images as they are sensed by the photoreceptors in the retina and passed on to higher levels of the visual system. In this way, the neural networks of the visual system function much like the image-compression algorithms devised for telecommunications. The authors explain this correspondence and describe their work to demonstrate the self-organizing principle behind this phenomenon.},

   abstract = {Scenes contain many statistical regularities that could benefit visual processing if accounted for by the visual system. One such statistic is the orientation-averaged slope (alpha) of the amplitude spectrum of natural scenes. Human observers show different discrimination sensitivity to alpha: sensitivity is highest for alpha values between 1.0 and 1.2 and decreases as alpha is steepened or shallowed. The range of alpha for peak discrimination sensitivity is concordant with the average alpha of natural scenes, which may indicate that visual mechanisms are optimized to process information at alpha values commonly encountered in the environment. Here we explore the association between peak discrimination sensitivity and the most viewed alphas in natural environments. Specifically, we verified whether discrimination sensitivity depends on the recently viewed environments. Observers were immersed, using a Head-Mounted Display, in an environment that was either unaltered or had its average alpha steepened or shallowed by 0.4. Discrimination thresholds were affected by the average shift in alpha, but this effect was most prominent following adaptation to a shallowed environment. We modeled these data with a Bayesian observer and explored whether a change in the prior or a change in the likelihood best explained the psychophysical effects. Change in discrimination thresholds following adaptation could be explained by a shift in the central tendency of the prior concordant with the shift of the environment, in addition to a change in the likelihood. Our findings suggest that expectations on the occurrence of alpha that result from a lifetime of exposure remain plastic and able to accommodate for the statistical structure of recently viewed environments.},

   abstract = {Anisotropies in visual perception have often been presumed to reflect an evolutionary adaptation to an environment with a particular anisotropy. Here, we adapt observers to globally-atypical environments presented in virtual reality to assess the malleability of this well-known perceptual anisotropy. Results showed that the typical bias in orientation perception was in fact altered as a result of recent experience. Application of Bayesian modeling indicates that these global changes of the recently-viewed environment implicate a Bayesian prior matched to the recently experienced environment. These results suggest that biases in orientation perception are fluid and predictable, and that humans adapt to orientation biases in their visual environment “on the fly” to optimize perceptual encoding of content in the recently-viewed visual world.},

About 25% of the images in our sample have spectra which show significant curvature when plotted on log-log coordinates. The best-fitting regression lines have slopes that range from -0.8 to -1.5; the average slope is -1.2, rather steeper than previously suggested.},

   abstract = {Thresholds were measured for discriminating changes in the slopes of the amplitude spectra of stimuli derived from photographs of natural scenes and from random-luminance patterns. The variety and magnitudes of the thresholds could be explained by a model based on the discrimination of the changes in band-limited local contrast. Different spatial scales of local contrast (or different spatial-frequency bands of about 1 octave) were implicated for different reference spectral slopes; the model implicated a lower frequency-band for stimuli with shallower amplitude spectra. The implications of the model were tested experimentally by using stimuli in which the spectra were changed within restricted spatial-frequency bands. When the amplitude spectra of the test and reference stimuli differed only within the implicated frequency bands, thresholds were affected little. However, when the test and reference spectra differed at all frequencies except those in the implicated bands, the thresholds were elevated markedly. The forms of the psychometric functions for the discrimination task were entirely compatible with the hypothesis that the task relies upon the ability to discriminate changes of contrast. The Weibull functions fitted to the data had slope parameters (beta) in the range 1 to 3, compatible with discrimination of low (but suprathreshold) contrasts.},

   abstract = {Natural images have a characteristic spatial structure, with amplitude spectra that decrease with frequency roughly as 1/f. We have examined how contrast (pattern-selective) adaptation to this structure influences the spatial sensitivity of the visual system. Contrast thresholds and suprathreshold contrast and frequency matches were measured after adaptation to random samples from an ensemble of images of outdoor scenes or of synthetic images formed by filtering the amplitude spectra of noise over a range of spectral slopes. Adaptation selectively reduced sensitivity at low-to-medium frequencies, biasing contrast sensitivity toward higher frequencies. The pattern of aftereffects was similar for different natural image ensembles but varied with large changes in the slope of the noise spectra. Our results suggest that adaptation to the spatial structure in natural scenes may exert strong and selective influences on perception that are important in characterizing the normal operating states of the visual system.},

   abstract = {The visual system employs a gain control mechanism in the cortical coding of contrast whereby the response of each cell is normalised by the integrated activity of neighbouring cells. While restricted in space, the normalisation pool is broadly tuned for spatial frequency and orientation, so that a cell's response is adapted by stimuli which fall outside its 'classical' receptive field. Various functions have been attributed to divisive gain control: in this paper we consider whether this output nonlinearity serves to increase the information carrying capacity of the neural code. 46 natural scenes were analysed with the use of oriented, frequency-tuned filters whose bandwidths were chosen to match those of mammalian striate cortical cells. The images were logarithmically transformed so that the filters responded to a luminance ratio or contrast. In the first study, the response of each filter was calibrated relative to its response to a grating stimulus, and local image contrast was expressed in terms of the familiar Michelson metric. We found that the distribution of contrasts in natural images is highly kurtotic, peaking at low values and having a long exponential tail. There is considerable variability in local contrast, both within and between images. In the second study we compared the distribution of response activity before and after implementing contrast normalisation, and noted two major changes. Response variability, both within and between scenes, is reduced by normalisation, and the entropy of the response distribution is increased after normalisation, indicating a more efficient transfer of information.},

   abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

Models of feature detection hypothesize that salient features are localized based on contrast energy (local variance in intensity) in the visual stimulus. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested directly. We used psychophysical reverse correlation to study how humans detect and identify basic image features (bars and short line segments). Subjects detected a briefly flashed 'target bar' that was embedded in 'noise bars' that randomly changed in intensity over space and time. By studying how the intensity of the noise bars affected performance, we were able to dissociate two processing stages: an early 'detection' stage, whereby only locations of high-contrast energy in the image are selected, followed (after approximately 100 ms) by an 'identification' stage, whereby image intensity at selected locations is used to determine the identity (whether bright or dark) of the target.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},
